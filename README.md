# Mathematical-Physics-Practical-Semester-1
Complete Mathematical Physics-I (MP-1) computational practicals for B.Sc (Hons) Physics under the NEP framework. Includes combinatorics, random numbers, area/volume, projectile motion, damped oscillators, numerical differentiation/integration, distributions, CLT, transformations, and linear regression in Python.

MP-1 Computational Physics Practicals

This repository contains the complete set of Mathematical Physics-I (MP-1) computational practicals for the B.Sc (Hons) Physics NEP curriculum. All programs are implemented in Python and make use of scientific libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy where required.

The practicals cover numerical methods, random processes, classical mechanics simulations, coordinate transformations, Monte-Carlo techniques, and statistical analysis as prescribed for MP-1.
